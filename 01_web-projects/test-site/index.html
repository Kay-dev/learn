  <p>Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox, is a free and open-source[24] web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation
    and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages.[25] In
    2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more
    intuitive user interface.[26] Firefox is available for Windows 7 or Windows 10, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial
    ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems including FreeBSD,[8] OpenBSD,[9] NetBSD,[10]
    illumos,[11] and Solaris Unix.[13] Firefox is also available for Android and iOS. However, the iOS version uses the
    WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform requirements, as with all other iOS web browsers. An optimized
    version of Firefox is also available on the Amazon Fire TV, as one of the two main browsers available with Amazon's
    Silk Browser.[27]</p>
  <p>Firefox was created in 2002 under the code name "Phoenix" by the Mozilla community members who desired a standalone
    browser, rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle. During its beta phase, Firefox proved to be popular with
    its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft's then-dominant Internet
    Explorer 6. Firefox was released on November 9, 2004,[28] and challenged Internet Explorer's dominance with 60
    million downloads within nine months.[29] Firefox is the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator, as the Mozilla
    community was created by Netscape in 1998 before their acquisition by AOL.[30]</p>
  <p>Firefox usage share grew to a peak of 32.21% at the end of 2009,[31] with Firefox 3.5 overtaking Internet Explorer
    7, although not all versions of Internet Explorer as a whole.[32][33] Usage then declined in competition with Google
    Chrome.[31] As of August 2021, according to StatCounter, Firefox has 7.62% usage share as a "desktop" web browser,
    making it the fourth-most popular web browser after Google Chrome (68.76%), Safari (9.7%) and Microsoft Edge
    (8.1%),[34] while its usage share across all platforms is lower at 3.45% in third place (after Google Chrome with
    65.27% and Safari with 18.34%).[35]</p>
